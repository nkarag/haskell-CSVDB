<<<20170427		implement 
					* (DONE) GroupBy and (DONE) Aggregation
					* upsertRtuple (wrapper over HashMap.insert), singleton RTable
					* (DONE) Change the AggOperation data type from a sum type to a product type and implement the various agg operations as values of the product type.

					* Dedublicate and 
					* Merge operations 
				with Data.List groupby and nubby functions

<<<20170427		Create a minimal set of COMMANDS that will be used in order to process CSV files either from a command line, or via a script in a file.
				We must be able to pattern match on these commands. Basically we need the following functions:

					parseCommand :: Text -> Command -- Parse user input (Text) and trasnfrom it into a structured Command data type
					parsePredicate :: Text -> Predicate  -- Parse user input (Text) and transform it into a structured Predicate data type
															 -- a predicate is an expression of filter and/or join predicates connected by Logical Operations

					cmdToEtlMap :: Command -> ETLMapping  -- Transform the Command to an ETLMapping that is ready to be executed and yield final result (an RTable)

				Also we will need basic Input / Output functions for the corresponding input/output commands like the following:

					importCSV :: Command -> RTable
					listCSV :: RTable  -> IO()
					exportCSV :: RTable -> IO()


<<<20170421		Check SQL parser at: http://jakewheat.github.io/simple-sql-parser/latest/


-- COMPLETED

<<<20170505		Implement Left and Right Outer Joins
20170509>>>> (Completion)

<<<20170505		csvToRTable must include "empty column logic" i.e., turn ",," "^," ",$" to a Null RDataType in the corresponding RTuple
20170509>>>> (Completion)

<<<20170328		Run some tests to test relational operations (filter OK, projection OK, join OK, union OK, intersection OK, difference OK) and 
				ETLMappings : 
					add new columns (RMap1x1) OK, 
					change existing column names (RMap1x1) OK, 
					value transformations (RMap1x1) OK, 
					RMapNx1 OK
					RMap1xN OK
					RMapNxM OK
20170421>>>> (Completion)


<<<20170315		implement the ETLMapping concept and the function runETLmapping - DONE
							runUnaryETLOperation - DONE
							runBinaryETLOperation - DONE
							runUnaryROperation - DONE
							runBinaryROperation - DONE
							runInnerJoin - DONE
20170328>>>> (Completion)

<<<20170313	Implement  concept of fixed column-order per RTuple with a HashMap ColOrder ColumnName, where type ColOrder = Int. This triggers changes in the following:
				- RTupleMData
				- ColumnInfo
				- createRTableMData
				- csvToRTable
				- RTableToCSV
20170314>>> (Completion)

<<<20170307	type RTupleMData =   HM.HashMap ColumnName ColumnInfo --> it does not keep the column order specified when we call RTable.createRTableMData, we need to change HashMap to a List, 				Also fix bug in rtableToCSV so as in the list [(ColumnInfo, RDataType)] the columns correpsonf to the approproate RDataTypes 
			
20170307>>> (Completion)

<<<20170306	Change RDate to hold each date component separately (year, month, day, hour, min, sec) and make it an instance of Eq and Ord, so that you can order RDates 
20170306>>> (Completion)

<<<20170303	Change rtableToCSV to also write the Header in the first line, based on table metadata
20170306>>> (Completion)
