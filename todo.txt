<<<20170609		Exploit SQL Parser: http://jakewheat.github.io/simple-sql-parser/latest/#simple-sql-parser
				in order to implement an SQL command line interface over CSVs

				Usage example:

				parseQueryExpr   SQL2011 "error.file" Nothing "Select * from tab1, tab2 where acol > bcol group by acol having count(*) > 2"


<<<20170427		Create a minimal set of COMMANDS that will be used in order to process CSV files either from a command line, or via a script in a file.
				We must be able to pattern match on these commands. Basically we need the following functions:

					parseCommand :: Text -> Command -- Parse user input (Text) and transform it into a structured Command data type
					parsePredicate :: Text -> Predicate  -- Parse user input (Text) and transform it into a structured Predicate data type
															 -- a predicate is an expression of filter and/or join predicates connected by Logical Operations

					cmdToEtlMap :: Command -> ETLMapping  -- Transform the Command to an ETLMapping that is ready to be executed and yield final result (an RTable)

				Also we will need basic Input / Output functions for the corresponding input/output commands like the following:

					importCSV :: Command -> RTable
					listCSV :: RTable  -> IO()
					exportCSV :: RTable -> IO()

    Julius works top-to-bottom. Outer joins, as well as Difference and Intersection have been fixed to work, due to problem with Null logic (equality comparison with Null, always returns False)
		    
<<<20170810		Start a new branch and experiment with 
					*a top-to-bottom (left-to-right) Julius syntax as well as --> DONE
					*a new syntax that allows to name intermediate results in a chain of ETLMappings and refer to this name as a table (Tab name) at a later ETLMapping. --> DONE
					*update readme.md --> DONE
					* merge git branch to master --> DONE

<<<20170825		- Implement "Null Logic" for RDataTypes. Create an Eq Instance of RDataType and make == and /= comparison with Null to return always False.
				- Then create separate isNull :: RDataType -> Bool and isNotNull = not.isNull functions to be used whenever you need to make such comparisons
				- Rengineer code where == or /= comparison with Null appears and change it to use isNull or isNotNull
